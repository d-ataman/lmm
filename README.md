# A Latent Morphology Model for Open-Vocabulary Neural Machine Translation


This software implements the Neural Machine Translation model based on Hierchical Character-based Decoding using Variational Inference.

## Options

### Hiearchical Decoder with Compositional Word Embeddings and Character-level Generation with Variational Inference 

  To activate the character-level decoder, select

  ```-tgt_data_type characters``` in the settings of preprocess.py and translate.py 

  and

  ```-decoder_type vae_charrnn``` in train.py
  
  The feature dimensions are hardcoded to 100 for the lemma and 10 for inflectional feature vectors, you can change this depending on your language or data size.
